# Graduate Career

Welcome to your graduate career!

This repository includes:

 * Templates for quarterly reports
 * Issue templates for tracking progress on things like getting your committee going, writing papers, etc.
 * Templates for how to set up your thesis project

## Your Responsibilities

You will be tasked with writing quarterly reports, tracking progress on your milestones, and using this repository as a space to continue working on your degree.

Conversations can take place here, so that there is a record.  This repository will be private by default, and should be considered a safe space for collaboration and discussion.

## Using this repository

You may find this repository much easier to interact with using the [gh](https://cli.github.com/) command.  You can use this to create issues, for instance:

```bash
gh issue create -F issue_templates/write_paper.md -w
```

This would read the template, open an editor for you to modify the text, and create the issue.
