# Quarterly Report for YOUR NAME HERE

This should be copied and renamed in the form `YYYY-QX.md` where `YYYY` is the 4-digit year and `X` is 1, 2, 3, 4 for each of the four quarters of the year.

Below are the sections to fill out.  Not all sections will necessarily have components; for those that do not, indicate "Nothing to report."  This should not be viewed as a problem -- sometimes you will go years without a paper, which is not necessarily a bad thing!

When done, delete this header text from the file, add it in a branch, and issue a pull request with Matt as a reviewer.

## Progress toward degree

List all bureaucratic steps you have taken this quarter.  Committees assembled, forms submitted, etc.

If you are enrolled in classes while writing this report, include those here.
